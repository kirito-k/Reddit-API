# Reddit-API
## Instructions:
This is a starters guide for someone who is about to start coding with Reddit's API.

We will be using PRAW, Reddit's API wrapper. API wrappers allows us to perform API calls without worrying about
all complexities underneath the call.

## Requirements
- Install Praw using 
```
pip install praw
```

## Implementation
1. Clone the repository.
2. From your newly created App on Reddit API Apps page, copy the keys and paste them into relevant sections of the
'config.JSON' file. Creating a config file is a good way to avoid having the authentication keys directly inside main code.
3. Run the main code
```
python redditAPI.py
``` 

Enjoy
